> "Mimetic theory" is not a synonym of "mimetic desire"

> People don't just fight over objects that are scarce and that they cannot share. They also fight over objects they can share but do not want to share (due to the mimetic nature of their desire).
>
> The Gospel account of the crucifixion (and the revelation of the scapegoat mechanism) and the mythical account of sacrifice (and the concealment of the scapegoat mechanism).
