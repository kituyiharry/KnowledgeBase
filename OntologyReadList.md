- why most ontologies fail -> big data ??
- - Silo problem (everyone ends up creating their own ontology)
- - - Solve by making it hard to build ontologies
- - - neighbour compatibility
- - Building for data already known - breaks on new data (- overfitting)
- - - short half life
- - - Solve by abstracting from data via entities as proxies to the data
- - each ontology is an ontology onto itself that needs to be described
- - - Create a standard (ISO21838) (why of course!)
- - - modularity
- - - - domain experts

- - small, evolving, formal
- Gene ontology and Gene sequences and tagging
- - Incredibly useful (in their contributions)
- - Gene ontology and Species
