## Premium types

Most retail insurance policies have the option for a stepped or a level premium.

Generally,
    - level premiums are cheaper in the long term but more expensive at commencement,
    as they remain somewhat 'level' throughout the policy's life.
    - stepped premiums are an exponential line, increasing in cost, but start
    comparatively lower to level premiums.

Hybrid policies
    - AIA for example does 'optimum' premiums which will charge you whichever
    premium is cheaper between the stepped and level options.

Cost of financial advice
    - Insurance is not cheap for a planner to write, especially if you have a complex medical history. You could be in for a large upfront fee for a Statement of Advice.
    - ~$4,000 - $9,000 (however this included replacing policies from a planner who was previously churning and an AFCA claim).

Tax deductions
    - Some retail Life & TPD insurance policies attract a 15% premium rebate when held inside superannuation.
    Read the PDS.
    - Income Protection insurance is tax deductible whether it's held in your own name or inside superannuation. If on claim, payments are taxable.
    - Trauma insurance premiums are not tax deductible, however, any benefit paid is tax-free.

Policy portability
    - Holding TPD or Income Protection insurance inside of superannuation also means you must meet a condition of release to access your payout. There may be tax implications if you are under your preservation age.
    - You can hold certain policies 'on platform' even while outside superannuation. For example, holding a BT life insurance policy and funding it via BT Panorama will attract a 5% platform discount.
