## Terms

- Premium: Fee to keep up health insurance
  - Loose all insurance if you stop
    - Every month

- Deductible: What you pay for a medical test ?
  - 100$ deductible covers 100$ test
  - Subsequent tests covered by insurance after deductible exhausted -
    - depending on insurer position
    - resets with your plan (usually renewing every year)
    - low Premium = high deductible and vice versa

  Lemma:
    - in low Premium high deductible - They will make you cover the full cost!!
    - Catastrophic health plan is the name of these
    - plan doesn't really cover ANYTHING!!
    - This is usually under 30s only
    - just a few basic check ups

- CoPay and CoInsurance:
  - High Premium , Low deductible situation
  - So you've payed the whole deductible
  - CoPays: Set amount to pay on receiving certain tests
    - Seemingly unescapable cost
  - CoInsurance: Split cost with the insurer - better if its lower (i.e 20% means you pay 20$ on 100% cost)
    - 100% CoInsurance means you pay EVERYTHING!!
