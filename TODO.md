# URGENT
- Switch from vim9 to neovim - stuff is beginning to break
- SOFTWARE FOR ROBOTS:AN ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW!

## Backthought
Knowledge base software
 -	problems is describing ontologies
 - A tag is a predicate. Sub-tags are implication (male author => author).
  - Tag aliases are equivalence (implication in both directions)1
  - How libraries organize information
  - Tagging vs Filing
  - https://karl-voit.at/tagstore/en/papers.shtml
 - Doubt system
 - formats for storing and querying
Photovoltaics, Solar panels and UV bands
- colored bin-packing an graph edge symbolic coloring
