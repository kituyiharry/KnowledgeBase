It can be shown that all fields are vector spaces over themselves (all vector spaces are defined over a field). Therefore, the complex numbers are also a vector space. Any complex number is also map from the vector space of complex numbers into itself (a complex number times another complex number is still a complex number; reals are a subspace)

a + bi ->  [[ a -b ]
           [ b  a ]]

```
    (a + bi)(c + di)

    ac - bd + (ad + bc)i

    ac - bd
    bc + ad

    [[ a  -b]  |c
    [  b   a]] |d
```

ident 1 ~= ident matrix `[[1 0][0 1]]`

i ~= `[[ 0 -1 ] [1 0]]`

i^2 ~= -1(` [[1 0][0 1]] `)

multiplication is commutative

complex conjugate ~= Matrix transposition

sqrt(a + b) as dist?? ~= Det(Mat)

e^(theta i) ~= cos(theta) + i sin(theta) :.

 @@ exp((0 -theta)(theta 0)) ~= ROT2D ~= `[[cos_theta  -sin_theta][sin_theta cos_theta]]`

 deriv (ie^(theta i)) ~= -sin_theta + i cos_theta
